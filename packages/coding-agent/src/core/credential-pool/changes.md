## 2026-10-23 - A limit's backoff stops at the subscription window; more reset formats parse (senpi#4091, senpi#3348)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts`: `rateLimitCooldown` stops doubling at `BACKOFF_CEILING_MS` (5 hours, the shortest subscription window), so failed half-open probes on a limit that names no reset can no longer grow its block toward the 48-hour cap. A reset the provider names still floors the block up to that cap. A zero `extract429RetryAfterMs` hint no longer hides the reset a usage limit names.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/reset-time.ts`: relative resets accept compact units (`4h9m10s`) and `reset after`, and Z.ai's zone-less `reset at YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` reads as UTC+8.

### Why

senpi#4091: `failureCount` rises on every failed probe and resets only on success, so a spent slot probed while still limited stayed blocked for up to 48 hours after its real window reset. senpi#3348: the unparsed formats pushed those slots onto that no-reset path.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Credential rotation classifies and persists slot health before an error reaches extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The backoff line of `rateLimitCooldown` and the hint selection in the rate-limit branch of `classifyCredentialFailure`.
- The relative-prose regexes in `reset-time.ts`.

## 2026-10-22 - Temporary failures never become auth blocks (senpi#2081)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts`: `ACCOUNT_POOL_REFUSAL_NOTE` marks a local refusal from a provider that runs its own account pool, and that refusal now fails the request instead of blocking the outer slot. A 408, 5xx or 529 status decides before body text, so "unauthorized" or "billing" in such a body no longer means `auth_error` or `account_disabled`. A 429 that mentions authentication, and a 403 that reports a rate limit, now cool down. Only a 401, or auth text on a non-temporary status, blocks a slot as `auth_error`.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts` also treats a statusless failure that names a timeout, reset, gateway or overload as temporary, so a custom provider's non-standard body can no longer persist a block.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/state-store.ts`: `clearProvider()` drops a provider's health entries; a clean file is only read. `ModelRuntime` uses it to retire the outer-slot blocks older builds left for a lane that now owns its account selection.
- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/failover.ts`: when no slot can serve, the error names each slot with its reason and the time it is due back, instead of a bare "No credential slots available".

### Why

senpi#2081: the outer pool wraps the Anthropic Subscription lane, which picks from all of its accounts itself. When one account was revoked and another was briefly rate-limited, the lane reported "authentication error". The outer pool then persisted `auth_error` against every outer slot within one request, and every later request failed with "No credential slots available" until the re-probe time or a re-login, even with the pinned account healthy.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Credential rotation classifies and persists slot health before an error reaches extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The early branches of `classifyCredentialFailure` (auth, 403, billing and rate-limit order).
- The no-candidate throw in `runCredentialFailover`.

## 2026-10-17 - envSlotVarNames: every name the env slots read (senpi#3531)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/env-slots.ts`: `envSlotVarNames()` lists the primary variable and `<VAR>_2` .. `<VAR>_16` for every provider with env slots, `anthropic-subscription` (`CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`) included. It uses the same `primaryEnvVar` and `MAX_ENV_SLOT_INDEX` as `discoverEnvSlots`.

### Why

senpi#3531: the host daemon allowlist must pass exactly the names slot discovery reads.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Slot discovery is core credential resolution, not an extension surface.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/env-slots.ts`: the import line and the new function above `discoverEnvSlots`.

## 2026-10-07 - Retry a transient refresh on the same slot (senpi#2893)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/classify.ts`: branded transient OAuth refresh returns `retry_same` with the existing attempt limit before status/message classification.

### Why

A healthy slot was failed or blocked when its refresh endpoint was temporarily unavailable.

### Why an extension could not handle it

Credential rotation invokes this classifier before an error reaches extension hooks.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- The first branch of `classifyCredentialFailure`; permanent login/account switching remains #2304's scope.

## 2026-10-16 - Rotation never hands a session the other kind's slot (#3486)

### What changed

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-slots.ts`: `listRotationSlots` lists only `slotsOfOwnKind(credential)`, so a mixed pool written by older builds (an API key appended under an OAuth login) offers only its OAuth slots to per-session selection.

### Why

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-slots.ts`: HRW selection could pick the key slot, which the OAuth credential cannot project, so that session resolved no credential (#3486 review, TUI footer showed `openrouter@login-2`).

### Why an extension could not handle it

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-slots.ts` builds the candidate set every pooled request selects from.

### Expected merge conflict zones

- `packages/coding-agent/src/core/credential-pool/rotation-slots.ts`: the stored-lane loop in `listRotationSlots` and its imports.
